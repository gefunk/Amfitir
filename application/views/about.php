		Container Shipping

		<p>With the rapid growth in the volume of world trade, the ocean container shipping industry has become increasingly complex and sometimes confusing to shippers as well as forwarders. Since the beginning of containerisation in the 1950's the industry has grown to see some 18 million containers making 200 million trips each year, carried by more than 200 vessel-operating container carriers, defined as those having regular and repetitive sailing schedules, comprising ocean carriers, short sea operators and feeder lines.</p>

		<p>The average shipper books containers with no more than the same half-dozen carriers, which is surprising considering the vast number of carriers world-wide. This can be explained since one of the most difficult tasks for a shipper or forwarder is to find which carrier sails on which routes, and up until now making a thorough search of each carrier's schedules was just not practical. And, until recent years, shippers and forwarders tended to book containers only with carriers having local representation. Today, the internet has fundamentally changed the way we do business. Buyers and sellers often conclude their business without any human interaction at all. Today, it is just as easy to make a booking and pay a carrier on the other side of the world as it is with one down the street.</p>

		<p>Launched in February 2009, Linescape is the first independent website to present a comprehensive and impartial overview of the routes and schedules of all the world's carriers, thus giving shippers and forwarders the freedom and ease to choose the carrier best suited to any particular shipment. Our powerful search engine includes route and schedule details from over 100 carriers (with more added each week), all of which is interactive and regularly updated, allowing shippers and forwarders to quickly and easily find alternatives.</p>

		<p>Linescape is a team of professionals with combined experience from Silicon Valley and the container shipping industry, but operating independently from the shipping industry. We believe that the process of finding a carrier should be a simple one. Our aim is to help achieve this by presenting routing and scheduling information in a clear and easy to understand format, in order to save you time.</p>
